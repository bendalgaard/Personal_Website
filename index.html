      <h1>Introduction</h1>
	  <p>This is the personal website of Benjamin Dalgaard.  I am a Software Engineer and Adjunct Professor in the Chicago area.  This website is maintained mostly as a sandbox for my personal learning, but I also hope to post a little information about myself here for those who are interested.</p>
	  
	  <h1>Purpose of this site</h1>
	  <p>I currently work primarily on back-end systems. This site originated as a way to learn new technologies that I find interesting and want to learn more about.  Currently, that includes cloud computing with AWS, new languages such as Python and Go and the plenty of JavaScript libraries/frameworks that I wish I knew more about.</p>
	  
	  <h2>More to come&hellip;</h1>
	  <p>Clearly, there is not a lot of information here at the moment. I will have more in the future, but if you are looking for more current information about me I suggest taking a look at my <a href=http://www.linkedin.com/in/bendalgaard target=blank>LinkedIn profile</a>.  It has (mostly) up to date information about my professional work.</p>
